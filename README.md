# Writing a Function in JavaScript 

In JavaScript, functions are blocks of reusable code. They allow you to bundle functionality, make it more readable, and avoid repetition. Here's a brief tutorial on writing an arrow function in JavaScript.

##  1. Basic syntax 

* **const functionName = (params) => {
  // code to be executed
}**

**const**: const should be used whenever a function expression is assigned to a variable.
The function name: The name you choose for the function.
Parameters: Optional comma separated parameters. This is the data passed into the function. If there are no parameters, the () is still required.
The arrow syntax: Indicates that this will be a function.
The body: The statements that make up the function itself. Surrounded by curly braces.

**Example**:

* **const greet = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}**

**Tip**: Functions often perform actions, so naming with a verb can make it clear what the function does. Examples include fetchData( ), calculateArea( ), or printReport( ). 

## 2. Calling a function 

To execute the function, you *call* or *invoke* it by using its name followed by parentheses.

**Example**:

greet('Alice'); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!

## 3. Return values 

Functions can process data input and output a value using the *return* keyword.

**Example**: 

* **const addNums = (numA, numB) => {
  *return* numA + numB
}**

 * **const total = addNums(2, 4);**

 * **console.log(total) // Expected value: 6**
